# CSE260-Digital-Logic-Design

This course provides an introduction to digital systems such as computer, communication and information systems. Firstly, the course will cover Boolean algebra, digital logic gates, combinational logic circuits, decoders, encoders, multiplexers and demultiplexers. The course will then cover sequential circuits: asynchronous and synchronous counters, registers, flip-flops. An introduction to memory elements and registers will also be provided. Hands-on experience will be provided through lab works and lab project. The course includes a compulsory 3-hour laboratory work each week.
